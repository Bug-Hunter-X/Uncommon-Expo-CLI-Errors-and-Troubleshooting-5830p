Solutions vary depending on the specific error.  Common troubleshooting steps include:

1. **Check your project's `package.json` and `app.json` (or `expo.json`) files:** Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed and configured. Verify that your app.json is properly structured.
2. **Clean your project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and `yarn.lock` (or `package-lock.json`) file, then reinstall your dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. **Check your environment variables:** Expo CLI might rely on environment variables; confirm they're correctly set. 
4. **Examine your Expo config (expo.json or app.json):**  Verify correct configurations for assets, plugins, and other settings.
5. **Update Expo CLI and SDK:** Run `npm update -g expo-cli` to update the Expo CLI. Also check that your project's Expo SDK version is compatible with your Expo CLI version. 
6. **Restart your computer:** Sometimes a simple restart can resolve temporary system glitches.
7. **Check for conflicting dependencies:** Use a dependency tree visualization tool to identify potential conflicts. 
8. **Consult Expo's documentation:** Expo has extensive documentation that addresses various troubleshooting scenarios.
